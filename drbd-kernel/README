This is DRBD v9 module (there's v8 built-into the vanilla kernel)

The binary flavor of this package obviously won't apply to other kernel versions than the one shipped with the Slackware release.

If you run a different kernel from the release, you need to install the package using the build script.

Besides, to build the package for a kernel different from the running one e.g.

	KERNEL=5.10.60 ./drbd-kernel.SlackBuild
